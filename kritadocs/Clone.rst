The clone brush is a brush engine that allows you to paint with a
duplication of a section of a paint-layer. This is useful in
manipulation of photos and textures. You have to select a source and
then you can paint to copy or clone the source to a different area.
Other applications normally have a separate tool for this, Krita has a
brush engine for this.

Usage and Hotkeys
-----------------

To see the source, you need to set the brush-cursor settings to brush
outline.

The clone tool can now clone from the projection and it's possible to
change the clone source layer. Press :kbd:`Ctrl-Alt` click to select
a new clone source on the current layer. :kbd:`Ctrl` click to select
a new clone source point on the layer that was active when you selected
the clone op.

.. Warning::

   Ctrl+alt+click is temporarily disabled on 2.9.7

Healing
    This turns the clone brush into a healing brush: often used for
    removing blemishes in photo retouching, and maybe blemishes in
    painting.
Perspective correction
    Only works when there's a perspective grid visible.
Source Point move.
    This will determine whether you will replicate the source point per
    dab or per stroke. Can be useful when used with the healing brush.
Clone from all visible layers.
    Tick this to force cloning of all layers instead of just the active
    one.
