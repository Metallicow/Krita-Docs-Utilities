Preferences
===========

Krita is highly customizable and makes many settings and options
available to customize through the Preferences area. These settings are
accessed by going to <span class=“menuchoice”>Settings > Configure
Krita</span>.

Krita's preferences are saved in the file *kritarc*. This file is
located in ``C:\\Users\\\*username\*\\AppData\\Local\\krita`` on
Windows, ``~/.config/krita`` on Linux, and
``~/Library/Preferences/krita`` on OS X. If you would like to back
up your custom settings or synchronize them from one computer to
another, you can just copy this file. It even works across platforms!

Custom shortcuts are saved in a separate file *kritashortcutsrc* which
can also be backed up in the same way. This is discussed further in the
shortcuts section.
