Mirror Tools
============

Draw on one side while the mirror tool copies the results to the other.
These tools are found along the toolbar. You can move location of the
axis by grabbing the handle.

   **Vertical Mirror Tool** - Mirror the results along the vertical axis.

There are additional options for each tool. You can access these by the
clicking the drop-down to the right of each one.

-  Hide Mirror Line (toggle) -- Locks the mirror axis and hides the axis
   line
-  Lock (toggle) - hides the move icon on the axis line.
-  Move to Canvas Center - Moves the axis line to the center of the
   canvas

Mirroring along a rotated axis
------------------------------

The mirror tools do not allow for rotating around the axis. You can use
the `Multibrush Tool <Multibrush_Tool>`__ to accomplish this. With this
tool you can use a slider to set an angle on how to mirror. It also has
more advanced options besides basic symmetry as well.
