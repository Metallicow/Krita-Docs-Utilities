.svg, or Scalable Vector Graphics, is the most modern vector graphics
interchange file format out there.

Being vector graphics, svg is very light weight. This is because it
usually only stores coordinates and parameters for the maths involved
with vector graphics.

It is maintained by the w3c svg working group, who also maintain other
open standards that make up our modern internet.

While you can open up svg files with any text-editor to edit them, it is
best to use a vector program like Inkscape. Krita supports importing svg
via the add shape docker, but we hope to increase support in the future.

svg is designed for the internet, though sadly, because vector graphics
are considered a bit obscure compared to raster graphics, not a lot of
websites accept them yet. Hosting them on your own webhost works just
fine though.
