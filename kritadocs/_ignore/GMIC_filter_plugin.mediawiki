{{NewInVersion|3.2}}

G'Mic or GREYC's Magic for Image Computing is an opensource filter framework, or, it is an extra program you can download to have access to a whole lot of image filters.

Krita has had G'Mic integration for a long time, but this is its most stable incarnation.

You set it up as following:

# First download the proper krita plugin from [http://gmic.eu/download.shtml]
# Then, unzip and place it somewhere you can find it.
# Go to {{MenuChoice|Settings &amp;rarr; Configure Krita &amp;rarr; G'Mic plugin}} and set G'MIC to the filepath there.
# Then restart Krita.
