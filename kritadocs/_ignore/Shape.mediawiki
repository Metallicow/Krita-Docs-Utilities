==Experiment Option==

;Speed
:This makes the outputted contour jaggy. The higher the speed, the jaggier.
;Smooth
:Smoothens the output contour. This sows down the brush, but the higher the smooth, the smoother the contour.
;Displace
:This displaces the shape. The slow the movement, the higher the displacement and expansion. Fast movements shrink the shape.
;Winding Fill
:This gives you the option to use a 'non-zero' fill rules instead of the 'even-odd' fill rule, which means that where normally crossing into the shape created transparent areas, it now will not.
;Hard Edge
:Removes the ant-anliasing, to get a pixelized line.
