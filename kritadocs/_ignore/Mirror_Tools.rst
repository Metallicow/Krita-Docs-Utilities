Mirroring along a rotated axis
------------------------------

The mirror tools do not allow for rotating around the axis. You can use
the `Multibrush Tool <Multibrush_Tool>`__ to accomplish this. With this
tool you can use a slider to set an angle on how to mirror. It also has
more advanced options besides basic symmetry as well.
