{{ToolIcon|arrow}}

The Default or Basic Shape tool is used to select and manipulate vector elements (Shapes). 

You can select multiple vector elements by dragging a selection box around them or by holding &lt;kbd>Ctrl&lt;/kbd> and clicking objects one at a time. You can select a single item by clicking directly on it.
