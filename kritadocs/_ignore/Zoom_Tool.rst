   {{ToolIcon|zoom}}

The zoom tool allows you to zoom your canvas in and out discretely. It
can be found at the bottom of the toolbox, and you just it by selecting
the tool, and doing on the canvas will zoom in, while will zoom out.

You can reverse this behaviour in the Tool Options.

There's a number of hotkeys associated with this tool, which makes it
easier to access from the other tools:

   out fluently.
