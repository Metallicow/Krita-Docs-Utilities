.ora, or the Open Raster format, is an interchange format. It was
designed to replace `\*.psd <*.psd>`__ as an interchange format, as the
latter isn't meant for that. Like `\*.kra <*.kra>`__ it is loosely based
on the Open Document structure, thus a zip file with a bunch of xmls and
pngs, but where Krita's internal fileformat can sometimes have fully
binary chunks, \*.ora saves it's layers as `\*.png <*.png>`__ making it
fully open and easy to support.

As an interchange format, it can be expected to be heavy and isn't meant
for uploading to the internet.
