Welcome to the Krita Manual! In this section, we'll try to get you up to
speed.

If you are familiar with digital painting, we recommend checking out the
`introduction coming from other
software <Special:MyLanguage/Category:Introduction_coming_from_other_software>`__
category, which contains guides that get you up to speed with Krita by
comparing its functions to other software.

If you are new to digital art, just start with
`Installation <Special:MyLanguage/Installation>`__, which deals with
installing Krita, and continue on to `Starting
Krita <Special:MyLanguage/Starting_Krita>`__, which helps with making a
new document and saving it, `Basic
Concepts <Special:MyLanguage/Basic_Concepts>`__, in which we'll try to
quickly cover the big categories of Krita's functionality, and finally,
`Navigation <Special:MyLanguage/Navigation>`__, which helps you find
basic usage help, such as panning, zooming and rotating.

When you have mastered those, you can look into the dedicated
introduction pages for functionality in the `User
Manual <Special:MyLanguage/Category:User_Manual>`__, read through the
over arching concepts behind (digital) painting in the `General
Concepts <Special:MyLanguage/Category:General_Concepts>`__ section, or
just search the `Reference
Manual <Special:MyLanguage/Category:Reference_Manual>`__ for what a
specific button does.
