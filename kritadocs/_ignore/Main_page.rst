Welcome to Krita's documentation page. Krita is a sketching and painting
program designed for digital artists.

As you learn about Krita, keep in mind that it is not intended as a
replacement for Photoshop. This means that the other programs may have
more features than Krita for image manipulation tasks, such as stitching
together photos, while Krita's tools are most relevant to digital
painting, concept art, illustration, and texturing. This fact accounts
for a great deal of Krita's design.

This manual is a wiki and can be edited by anyone. If you would like to
help, you can log into the wiki after `registering for a KDE Identity
account <https://identity.kde.org/index.php?r=registration/index>`__,
and check the `Contributor's Readme <Contributors_Readme>`__. The bulk
of this wiki consists of the reference manual, but we encourage users to
contribute tutorials for Krita as well. If you create off-site content,
such as videos and step-by-step screenshot guides, let us know, and
we’ll put it up a link to share with everyone!
