Sometimes, you want to add an even border around a selection. Stroke
Selection allows you to do this. It's under

First make a selection and call up the menu:

.. figure:: Krita_stroke_selection_1.png
   :alt: Krita_stroke_selection_1.png

   Krita\_stroke\_selection\_1.png

The main options are about using the current brush, or lining the
selection with an even line. You can use the current foreground color,
the background color or a custom color.

Using the current brush allows you to use textured brushes:

Lining the selection also allows you to set the background color, on top
of the line width in pixels or inches:

.. figure:: Krita_stroke_selection_3.png
   :alt: Krita_stroke_selection_3.png
