   {{ToolIcon|rectangle}}

This tool can be used to paint rectangles, or create rectangle shapes on
a vector layer. Click and hold the left mouse button to indicate one
corner of the rectangle, drag to the opposite corner, and release the
button.

Hotkeys and Sticky-keys
-----------------------

There's no default hotkey for switching to rectangle.

If you hold <kbd>Shift</kbd> while drawing, a square will be drawn
instead of a rectangle. Holding <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> will change the way the
rectangle is constructed. Normally, the first mouse click indicates one
corner and the second click the opposite. With <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>, the
initial mouse position indicates the center of the rectangle, and the
final mouse position indicates a corner. You can press <kbd>Alt</kbd>
while still keeping the left mouse button down to move the rectangle to
a different location.

You can change between the corner/corner and center/corner drawing
methods as often as you want by pressing or releasing <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>,
provided that you keep the left mouse button pressed. With
<kbd>Ctrl</kbd> pressed, mouse movements will affect all four corners of
the rectangle (relative to the center), without <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>, one of
the corners is unaffected.
