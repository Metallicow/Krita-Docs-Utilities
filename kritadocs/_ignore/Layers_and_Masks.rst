Layers are a central concept in digital painting.

With layers you can get better control over your artwork, for example
you can color an entire artwork just by working on the separate color
layer and thereby not destroying the line art which will reside above
this color layer.

Furthermore, layers allow you to change the composition easier, and mass
transform certain elements at once.

Masks on the other hand allow you to selectively apply certain effects
on a layer, like transparency, transformation and filters.
