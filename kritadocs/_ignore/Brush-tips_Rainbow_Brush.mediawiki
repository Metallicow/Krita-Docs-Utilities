This should allow you to change the color depending on the pressure.

{{Warning|The brightness of the rainbow is relative to the color of the currently selected color, so make sure to select bright saturated colors for a bright rainbow!}}

Uncheck &lt;span class="menuchoice">Pressure&lt;/span> and check &lt;span class="menuchoice">Distance&lt;/span> to make the rainbow paint itself over distance. The slider below can be {{MouseButton|right}} to change the value with keyboard input.

When you are satisfied, give the brush a new name and save it.
