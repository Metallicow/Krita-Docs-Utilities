This docker allows you to select the global pattern. Using the open-file button you can import patterns. Some common shortcuts are the following:

* {{MouseButton|right}} a swatch will allow you to set tags.
* {{MouseButton|left}} a swatch will allow you to set it as global pattern.
* &lt;kbd>Ctrl&lt;/kbd> + Scroll you can resize the swatch sizes.
