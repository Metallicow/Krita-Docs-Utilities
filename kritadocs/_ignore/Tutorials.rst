Tutorials as a category is for step-by-step guides on how to get from
your base to a finished end-product.

These differ from `General
Concepts <Special:MyLanguage/Category:General_Concepts>`__ in that they
are focused on practical application and step by step examples instead
of explaining the theorectical basis of something.
