|Krita\_Patterns.PNG| \_\_NOTOC\_\_ Patterns are small raster files that
tile. They can be used as following:

-  As fill for a vector shape.
-  As fill-tool color.
-  As height-map for a brush using the 'texture' functionality.
-  As fill for a generated layer.

Adding new patterns
===================

You can add new patterns via the pattern docker, or the
pattern-quick-access menu in the toolbar. At the bottom of the docker,
beneath the resource-filter input field, there's the 'import resource'
and 'delete resource' buttons. Select the former to add png or jpg files
to the pattern list.

Similarly, removing patterns can be done by pressing the the 'delete
resource' button. Krita will not delete the actual file then, but rather
black list it, and thus not load it.

Temporary patterns and generating patterns from the canvas
----------------------------------------------------------

You can use the pattern drop-down to generate patterns from the canvas
but also to make temporary ones.

First, draw a pattern and open the pattern-drop down.

Then go into and first press <span class=“menuchoice”>Update</span> to
show the pattern in the docker. Check if it's right. Here, you can also
choose whether you use this layer only, or the whole image. Since 3.0.2,
Krita will take into account the active selection as well when getting
the information of the two.

Then, click either <span class=“menuchoice”>Use as Pattern</span> to use
it as a temporary pattern, or <span class=“menuchoice”>Add to predefined
patterns</span> to save it into your pattern resources!

You can then start using it in Krita by for example making a canvas and
doing <span class=“menuchoice”>edit &rarr; fill with pattern</span>

Pattern docker

You can tag patterns here, and filter them with the resource filter.
