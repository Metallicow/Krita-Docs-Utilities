;Question
:I was messing with the brushes and noticed there is like an option for it being "animated". What does it mean and how do I use it?

Basically, they’re what is officially called an ‘image hose’, and they’re quite fun. They are basically a brush-tip with multiple image files.

The typical way to make them is to first draw the ‘frames’ on a small canvas, per layer:

You can use &lt;kbd>Alt&lt;/kbd>+{{MouseButton|left}} on the layer thumbnails to isolate layers without hiding them.

When done you should have a mess like this.

Go into the brush settings(&lt;kbd>f5&lt;/kbd>), and go to &lt;span class="menuchoice">predefined brush-tips&lt;/span>, and click &lt;span class="menuchoice">stamp&lt;/span>. You will get this window.

And then use style &lt;span class="menuchoice">animated&lt;/span> and selection mode set to &lt;span class="menuchoice">random&lt;/span>.

Krita uses Gimp’s image hose format which allows for random selection of the images, angle based selection, pressure based selection, and incremental selection(I have no idea what constant does).

Then select the above brush and your new leafy-brush tip.

And use it to paint trees! (for example)

You can also use animated brush tips to emulate, for example, bristle brush tips that go from very fine bristles to a fully opaque stamp based on pressure, like a dry paintbrush might do. To do this, you would follow the above instructions, but for each layer, create a different cross-section of the brush to correspond with the amount of pressure applied.
