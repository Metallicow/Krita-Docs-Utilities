A Brush Engine inspired by the common artist's workflow where a simple big brush, like a marker, is used to fill large areas quickly, the Quick Brush engine is an extremely simple, but quick brush, which can give the best performance of all Brush Engines.

It can only change size, blending mode and spacing, and this allows for making big optimisations that aren't possible with other brush engines.
