{{ToolIcon|assistant}}

Create, edit, and remove drawing assistants on the canvas. There are a number of different assistants that can be used from this tool. The tool options allow you to add new assistants. To add an assistant, select a type from the tool options and begin clicking on the canvas. Each assistant is created a bit differently. There are also additional controls on existing assistants that allow you to move and delete them.
