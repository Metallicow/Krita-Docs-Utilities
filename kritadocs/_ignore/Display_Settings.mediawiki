[[File:Krita Preferences Display.png]]

Here various settings for the rendering of Krita can be edited.

===OpenGL=== 
OpenGL is a bit of code especially for graphics cards. Graphics cards a dedicate piece of hardware for helping your computer out with graphics calculations, which Krita uses a lot. All modern computer have graphics cards.

;Enable OpenGL
:Selecting this checkbox will enable the OpenGL canvas drawing mode. With a decent graphics card this should give faster feedback on brushes and tools. Also the canvas operations like Rotate,Zoom and Pan should be considerably faster. 
;Use Texture Buffer
:This setting utilizes the graphics card's buffering capabilities to speed things up a bit. Although for now, this feature may be broken on some AMD/Radeon cards and may work fine on some Intel graphics cards.
;Scaling Mode
:The user can choose which scaling mode to use while zooming the canvas. The choice here only affects the way the image is displayed during canvas operations and has no effect on how Krita scales an image when a transformation is applied.
*Nearest Neighbour - This is the fastest and crudest filtering method . While fast, this results 	in a large number of artifacts - 'blockiness' during magnification, and aliasing and 	shimmering during minification.
*Bilinear Filtering - This is the next step up.This removes the 'blockiness' seen during magnification and gives a smooth looking result. For most purposes this should be a good 	trade-off between speed and quality.
*Trilinear Filtering - This should give a little better result than Bilinear Filtering.
*High Quality Filtering - Only available when your graphics card supports OpenGL 3.0. As the name suggests, this setting provides the best looking image during canvas operations.

===Canvas Border===
;Color
:The user can select the color for the canvas i.e. the space beyond a document's boundaries. 
;Hide Scrollbars
:Selecting this will hide the scrollbars in all view modes. 

===Transparency Checkboxes=== 
Krita supports layer transparency. Of course, the nasty thing is that transparency can't be seen. So to indicate transparency at the lowest layer, we use a checker pattern. This part allows you to configure it.
;Size
:This sets the size of the checkers which show up in transparent parts of an image. 
;Color
:The user can set the colors for the checkers over here. 
;Move Checkers When Scrolling 
:When selected the checkers will move along with opaque elements of an image during canvas Panning, Zooming,etc.  Otherwise the checkers remain stationary and only the opaque parts of an image will move. 

===Miscellaneous===
;Color Channels in Color
:No Idea, currently crashes Krita.
;Enable Curve Anti-Aliasing
:This allows anti-aliasing on previewing curves, like the ones for the circle tool, or the path tool.
;Enable Selection Outline Anti-Aliasing
:This allows automatic anti-aliasing on selection. It makes the selection feel less jaggy and more precise.
