   {{ToolIcon|similar-select}}

This tool, represented by a dropper over an area with a dashed border,
allows you to make a selection by selecting a point of color. It will
select any areas of a similar color to the one you selected. You can
adjust the “fuzziness” of the tool in the tool options dock. A lower
number will select colors closer to the color that you chose in the
first place.

Hotkeys and Sticky keys
-----------------------

-  <kbd>R</kbd> sets the selection to 'replace' in the tool options,
   this is the default mode.
-  <kbd>A</kbd> sets the selection to 'add' in the tool options.
-  <kbd>S</kbd> sets the selection to 'subtract' in the tool options.
-  <kbd>Shift</kbd> + sets the subsequent selection to 'add'. You can
   release the <kbd>Shift</kbd> key while dragging, but it will still be
   set to 'add'. Same for the others.
-  <kbd>Alt</kbd> + sets the subsequent selection to 'subtract'.
-  <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + sets the subsequent selection to 'replace'.
-  <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>Alt</kbd> + sets the subsequent selection to
   'intersect'.
