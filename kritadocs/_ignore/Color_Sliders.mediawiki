You can configure this docker via &lt;span class="menuchoice">Settings &amp;rarr; Configure Krita &amp;rarr; Color Selector Settings &amp;rarr; Color Sliders&lt;/span>.

There, you can select which sliders you would like to see added, allowing you to even choose multiple lightness sliders together.
