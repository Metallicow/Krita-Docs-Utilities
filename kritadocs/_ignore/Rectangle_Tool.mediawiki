{{ToolIcon|rectangle}}

This tool can be used to paint rectangles, or create rectangle shapes on a vector layer. Click and hold the left mouse button to indicate one corner of the rectangle, drag to the opposite corner, and release the button.

==Hotkeys and Sticky-keys==
There's no default hotkey for switching to rectangle.

If you hold &lt;kbd>Shift&lt;/kbd> while drawing, a square will be drawn instead of a rectangle. Holding &lt;kbd>Ctrl&lt;/kbd> will change the way the rectangle is constructed. Normally, the first mouse click indicates one corner and the second click the opposite. With &lt;kbd>Ctrl&lt;/kbd>, the initial mouse position indicates the center of the rectangle, and the final mouse position indicates a corner. You can press &lt;kbd>Alt&lt;/kbd> while still keeping the left mouse button down to move the rectangle to a different location.

You can change between the corner/corner and center/corner drawing methods as often
as you want by pressing or releasing &lt;kbd>Ctrl&lt;/kbd>, provided that you keep the left mouse button pressed. With &lt;kbd>Ctrl&lt;/kbd> pressed, mouse movements will affect all four corners of the rectangle (relative to the center), without &lt;kbd>Ctrl&lt;/kbd>, one of the corners is unaffected.
