Question
    I was messing with the brushes and noticed there is like an option
    for it being “animated”. What does it mean and how do I use it?

Basically, they’re what is officially called an ‘image hose’, and
they’re quite fun. They are basically a brush-tip with multiple image
files.

The typical way to make them is to first draw the ‘frames’ on a small
canvas, per layer:

|Krita-animtedbrush.png| You can use <kbd>Alt</kbd>+ on the layer
thumbnails to isolate layers without hiding them.
|Krita-animtedbrush1.png| When done you should have a mess like this.

Go into the brush settings(<kbd>f5</kbd>), and go to <span
class=“menuchoice”>predefined brush-tips</span>, and click <span
class=“menuchoice”>stamp</span>. You will get this window.
|Krita-animtedbrush2.png| And then use style <span
class=“menuchoice”>animated</span> and selection mode set to <span
class=“menuchoice”>random</span>.

Krita uses Gimp’s image hose format which allows for random selection of
the images, angle based selection, pressure based selection, and
incremental selection(I have no idea what constant does).
|Krita-animtedbrush3.png| Then select the above brush and your new
leafy-brush tip. |Krita-animtedbrush4.png| And use it to paint trees!
(for example)

You can also use animated brush tips to emulate, for example, bristle
brush tips that go from very fine bristles to a fully opaque stamp based
on pressure, like a dry paintbrush might do. To do this, you would
follow the above instructions, but for each layer, create a different
cross-section of the brush to correspond with the amount of pressure
applied.
