==Hotkeys and Stickykeys==
*&lt;kbd>J&lt;/kbd> selects this tool.
*&lt;kbd>R&lt;/kbd> sets the selection to 'replace' in the tool options, this is the default mode.
*&lt;kbd>A&lt;/kbd> sets the selection to 'add' in the tool options.
*&lt;kbd>S&lt;/kbd> sets the selection to 'subtract' in the tool options.
*&lt;kbd>Shift&lt;/kbd> after starting the selection, constraints it to a perfect square.
*&lt;kbd>Ctrl&lt;/kbd> after starting the selection, makes the selection resize from center.
*&lt;kbd>Alt&lt;/kbd> after starting the selection, allows you to move it.
*&lt;kbd>Shift&lt;/kbd> + {{MouseButton|left}} sets the subsequent selection to 'add'. You can release the &lt;kbd>Shift&lt;/kbd> key while dragging, but it will still be set to 'add'. Same for the others.
*&lt;kbd>Alt&lt;/kbd> + {{MouseButton|left}} sets the subsequent selection to  'subtract'.
*&lt;kbd>Ctrl&lt;/kbd> + {{MouseButton|left}} sets the subsequent selection to  'replace'.
*&lt;kbd>Shift&lt;/kbd> + &lt;kbd>Alt&lt;/kbd> + {{MouseButton|left}}  sets the subsequent selection to  'intersect'.

{{ Note|So to subtract a perfect square, you do &lt;kbd>Alt + Left-Mouse-Click&lt;/kbd>, then release the &lt;kbd>Alt&lt;/kbd> key while dragging and press &lt;kbd>Shift&lt;/kbd> to constrain.}}

{{Note|You can switch the behaviour of the Alt key to use Ctrl instead by toggling the switch in the [[Special:MyLanguage/General_Settings#Tool_options|general settings]]}}
