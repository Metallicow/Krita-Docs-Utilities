How do I make a brush like the one in Sinix's paint-like-a-sculptor
video?

It's actually quite easy, but most easy to do with Krita 3.0 due a few
bugfixes.

First, select *Basic\_Wet* from the default presets, and go into the
brush editor with <kbd>f5</kbd>.

Then, the trick is to go into , untoggle from the sensors, toggle and
then reverse the curve as shown above. Make sure that the curve ends a
little above the bottom-right, so that you are aways painting something.
Otherwise, the smudge won't work.

This'll make the color rate decrease and turn it into a smudge brush as
the stroke continues:

The sensor will base the stroke length on brush size. The sensor will
base it on actual pixels, and the on actual seconds.

Then, select and select the default *A\_Angular\_Church\_HR* brushtip.

This makes for a nice textured square brush.

Of course, this'll make the stroke distance longer to get to smudging,
so we go back to the .

Just adjust the fade-length by on the slider bar. You can then input a
number. In the screenshot, I have 500, but the sweet spot seems to be
somewhere betwen 150 and 200.

Now, you'll notice that on the start of a stroke, it might be a little
faded, so go into and turn off the there.

Then, finally, we'll make the brush rotate.

Tick the parameter, and select it. There, untick and tick .

Then, for better angling, tick and set the to 90 degrees by the slider
bar and typing in 90.

Now, give your brush a new name, doodle on the brush-square, and paint!
