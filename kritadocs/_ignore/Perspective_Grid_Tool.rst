The perspective grid tool allows you to draw and manipulate grids on the
canvas that can serve as perspective guides for your painting. A grid
can be added to your canvas by first clicking the tool in the tool bar
and then clicking four points on the canvas which will serve as the four
corners of your grid.

The grid can be manipulated by pulling on any of its four corners. The
grid can be extended by clicking and dragging a midpoint of one of its
edges. This will allow you to expand the grid at other angles.This
process can be repeated on any subsequent grid or grid section. You can
join the corners of two grids by dragging one onto the other. Once they
are joined they will always move together, they cannot be separated. You
can delete any grid by clicking on the red X at its center. This tool
can be used to build reference for complex scenes.
