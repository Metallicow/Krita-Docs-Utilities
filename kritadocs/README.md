How to generate the docs
========================
In a console/terminal simply type...

```
make html
```

This should generate the html docs in "kritadocs/_build/html" directory.


Prerequisites
-------------

* https://www.python.org/ because it's the best!
* http://sphinx-doc.org/ for generating the docs.
* https://pandoc.org/ (Optional) for conversion of the .mediawiki syntax to .rst. See scripts directory.
