TODO List
=========

 =======================
 Manual Conversion Stuff
 =======================
 [ ] Basic conversion from the pandoc exports of all files/pages to .rst included in the index(Main_Page).rst TOC tree.
     [ ] Rereview all syntax changes/section/etc below in *this* TODO.txt.
     [ ] Mark the date of the .mediawiki files download in the readme/todo file so to track changes to the wiki with git/github thereafter all files/pages are initially converted.

 -----------
 Image Stuff
 -----------
 [ ] Download all page images(this apparently has to be done manually for each page, as I do them). Sort them out into images/pagename directories.(Sphinx will drop them all into a single dir when building)
        I've downloaded all images up to this page already `Flat Coloring`

 [ ] When all pages are done... Convert all .jpg to .png.
     Then run all .png's thru FileOptimizer ->  https://sourceforge.net/projects/nikkhokkho/files/FileOptimizer/
     Sorry FileOptimizer is only 'Windows', ...tho linux/mac could make a port gui app. It's just a bunch of utilities and commandline options...
     This "should" fix the pdf artifacts...

 [ ] Rename images as approriate for readability and consistency. Ex: No 500px- stuff at the beginning of a filename.
 
 [ ] lowercase all image extensions. Ex: .png instead of .PNG

 --------------
 Syntax Changes
 --------------
 [ ] Change <kbd>Ctrl + Shortcut</kbd> keyboard shortcuts. to :kbd:`Ctrl + Shortcut`

 [ ] Change <span class=“menuchoice”> Bla &rarr; Bla </span> to :menuselection:`Settings --> Dockers --> Brush Preset Docker`
     [ ] Uppercase the item texts like in the App menus. Ex: Window instead of window. Check all cases.
     [ ] Make sure all texts are worded like in the app.

 [ ] Collect .mediawiki infos for all the :search:'Special' pages and convert. mostly to interdoc links :doc:
 [ ] Convert inter-doc links to :doc:`pagename <pagename>`. pandoc didn't do these right.

 [ ] Pandoc choked on a few pages. Convert them manually.
     * Gamma_and_Linear.mediawiki needs fixedConverted/Manually to a .rst

 [ ] What to do with the <tt> tag... probably just erase them.

 [ ] .. raw:: mediawiki stuff. Most are `Note` and `Warning`. :see: `Info` todo item below.

 [ ] The mousebutton png and some other small images didnt show up in the converted rst. Check all these. :search: for these in the mediawiki files to pin down.
     As the mouse images are general, stick them into the substitutions.inc include file.

 [ ] `New in Krita *version*` stuff is missing from the converted docs.
      :see: * General_Settings.mediawiki/General_Settings.rst and :search: for these in the .mediawiki files to pin down all instances.

 --------------
 Page Structure
 --------------
 [ ] Every page needs a main header at the top. Only one of these per file/page. Pandoc screwed up on a few of these.

     Main Header
     ===========

 -----------------
 Custom Directives
 -----------------
 [ ] Figure out what to do with ..raw:: mediawiki   Info items.
     Currently I'm just converting them to .. Note:: . :search: the .mediawiki files later to pin point the ones needing changed back.
     I recall wxpython implemented a .. Info:: directive.
        :see: https://github.com/wxWidgets/Phoenix

 ----------
 Css Tweaks
 ----------
 [ ] Definition lists are not showing up as bolded. probably a css tweek. Other: manually **Bold** them all, a pain in the ass.


 -----------
 Translation
 -----------
 [ ] Cluttered with translation stuff. Not sure what to do other than list the files to be rereviewed by a translation guru.
     ...stuff like this:  <!--T:117-->
     * Basic_Concepts.rst  (Cleaned manually)
     * KritaFAQ.rst        (Still looks like a NIGHTMARE!)
     * Color_Smudge.rst    (Cleaned manually)

 ---------------------
 Misc/Other/Discussion
 ---------------------
 [ ] Make sure wikipages with contents get added to the rst docs. .. contents:: modifys the header text colors.... why? Should we maintain them manually?

     .. contents:: Contents
        :local:

     **Contents** (Manually done. Titles as links.)
        * 1 `Creating a New Document`_
           * 1.1 `Recent Document`_
           * 1.2 `Custom Document`_
           * 1.3 `Create From Clipboard:`_
           * 1.4 `Templates:`_
        * 2 `How to use brushes`_
        * 3 `Erasing`_
        * 4 `Saving and opening files`_

 [ ] .. figure::
        :figwidth: image

     doesn't allow :align: center to be centered.

 ---------------
 Main Page Stuff
 ---------------
 [ ] Investigate blender's .. container:: code(index) I used for the main_page.rst so as to fix grid alignment.
 [ ] Revise the main page wording as it won't be a "wiki" anymore.

 [ ] Color.rst needs color tables implemented in html or something. Maybe use an image?

 ----------------------------
 Polishing/Nearing Completion
 ----------------------------
 [ ] Handle catagory tree stucture in catagory pages.
 [ ] Let the krita folks tweak the theme, sidebars, extra html to their own liking if needbe. Maybe they want to imitate the mediawiki look...? I dunno...
