Curve
=====

The curve brush is a brush engine which creates strokes made of evenly
spaced lines. It has, among other things been used as a replacement for
pressure sensitive strokes in lieu of a tablet.

Settings
--------

First off, the line produced by the Curve brush is made up of 2
sections:

-  The connection line, which is the main line drawn by your mouse

-  The curve lines I think, which are the extra fancy lines that form at
   curves. The curve lines are formed by connecting one point of the
   curve to a point earlier on the curve. This also means that if you
   are drawing a straight line, these lines won't be visible, since
   they'll overlap with the connection line. Drawing faster gives you
   wider curves areas.

You have access to 3 settings from the Lines tab, as well as 2
corresponding dynamics:

-  Line width: this applies to both the connection line and the curve
   lines.

   -  Line width dynamics: use this to vary line width dynamically.

-  History size: this determines the distance for the formation of curve
   lines.

   -  If you set this at low values, then the curve lines can only form
      over a small distances, so they won't be too visible.
   -  On the other hand, if you set this value too high, the curve lines
      will only start forming relatively “late”.
   -  So in fact, you'll get maximum curve lines area with a mid-value
      of say... 40~60, which is about the default value. Unless you're
      drawing at really high resolutions.

-  Curves opacity: you can't set different line widths for the
   connection line and the curve lines, but you can set a different
   opacity for the curve lines. With low opacity, this will produce the
   illusion of thinner curve lines.

   -  Curves opacity dynamics: use this to vary Curves opacity
      dynamically.

In addition, you have access to two checkboxes:

-  Paint connection line, which toggles the visibility of the connection
   line
-  Smoothing, which... I have no idea actually. I don't see any
   differences with or without it. Maybe it's for tablets?

Drawing variable-width lines
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

And here's the only section of this tutorial that anyone cares about:
pretty lineart lines! For this:

-  Use the Draw Dynamically mode: I tend to increase drag to at least
   50. Vary Mass and Drag until you get the feel that's most comfortable
   for you.

-  Set line width to a higher value (ex.: 5), then turn line width
   dynamics on:

-

   -  If you're a tablet user, just set this to Pressure (this should be
      selected by default so just turn on the Line Width dynamics). I
      can't check myself, but a tablet user confirmed to me that it
      works well enough with Draw Dynamically.

-

   -  If you're a mouse user hoping to to get variable line width, set
      the Line Width dynamics to Speed.

-

   -  Note: the Speed trick works well on Linux, but on my Windows XP
      system the Speed setting is actually unstable, which makes this
      trick unusable. I don't know if this affects all Windows systems
      or just me, but if you encounter this problem, please confirm it
      at this `bug
      report <https://bugs.kde.org/show_bug.cgi?id=309619>`__.

-  Set Curves opacity to 0: This is the simplest way to turn off the
   Curve lines. That said, leaving them on will get you more
   “expressive” lines.

**Additional tips:**

-  Zig-zag a lot if you want a lot of extra curves lines.
-  Use smooth, sweeping motions when you're using Draw Dynamically with
   Line Width set to Speed: abrupt speed transitions will cause abrupt
   size transitions. It takes a bit of practice, and the thicker the
   line, the more visible the deformities will be. Also, zoom in to
   increase control.
-  If you need to vary between thin and thick lines, I suggest creating
   presets of different widths, since you can't vary the base line width
   from the canvas.

Alternative:

-  Use the Draw Dynamically mode
-  Set Curves opacity to 100
-  Optionally decrease History size to about 30

The curve lines will fill out the area they cover completely, resulting
in a line with variable widths. Anyway, here are some comparisons:
